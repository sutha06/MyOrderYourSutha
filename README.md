This project is developed as part of the PROG31975 - Advanced Mobile App Development course. Built in Swift with SwiftUI, 
the app follows the MVVM architecture and utilizes CoreData to store and manage pizza order details. The app provides users with an intuitive interface to select pizza details, 
including type, size, and quantity, which are saved into CoreData instead of temporary data structures like arrays or dictionaries. 
Each order is stored with relevant attributes such as a unique identifier, pizza type, size, quantity, and order date.

Upon placing an order, users can view a comprehensive list of past orders sorted by the most recent, with the ability to update or delete specific orders directly from the list. 
The project adheres to professional coding standards with clear organization and naming conventions, ensuring readability and maintainability. 
Aesthetics and user experience are optimized to align with modern iOS standards, and exception handling is implemented to prevent crashes due to invalid inputs or errors.

This app is compatible with the iPhone 15 simulator, providing a smooth and reliable ordering experience.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it for your learning, or use it as a reference for implementing CoreData and MVVM in SwiftUI applications.
